## Migration Summary

The CreativeStudio application has been successfully migrated to the Replit environment:

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks:
- **Dependencies**: All required npm packages installed and verified
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database provisioned and schema applied
- **Application**: Frontend and backend running successfully on port 5000
- **Verification**: Website displays correctly with navigation, hero section, and multilingual support
- **Final Check**: Application re-verified on October 14, 2025 - fully operational

## Full System Audit (October 14, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Bugs Fixed:
1. **Database Connection Issue** - Database was not provisioned; created PostgreSQL database and applied schema
2. **LSP Error** - Fixed TypeScript error in server/routes.ts:783 (req.admin?.id -> req.user?.id)
3. **Critical Admin Panel Bug** - Admin endpoints were only showing published items; added getAllCasesForAdmin() and getAllPostsForAdmin() methods to show all items including drafts

### ‚úÖ Systems Tested:
- **API Endpoints**: All working correctly (services, cases, posts, testimonials, contacts)
- **Multilingual Support**: RU/KZ/EN language switching working perfectly
- **Forms & Validation**: Contact form with Zod validation working correctly
- **Admin Panel**: CMS functionality verified, now shows all items including unpublished
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system working (with auto-generated secret for dev)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema applied successfully

### üìù Notes:
- The application is a Digital & Brandformance Agency website
- Supports multiple languages (RU/KZ/EN)
- Includes CMS functionality for managing services, cases, blog posts, and testimonials
- Database is empty (ready for content to be added via CMS)
- Admin login available at /admin route
- Minor WebSocket errors related to development environment (expected behavior, does not affect functionality)
- JWT_SECRET auto-generated for development (should be set manually for production)

### üöÄ Next Steps for User:
1. Access the admin panel at /admin to create initial content
2. Add services, portfolio cases, blog posts, and testimonials
3. Customize the content for their business needs
4. Set JWT_SECRET environment variable for production deployment
