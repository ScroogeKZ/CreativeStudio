## Migration Summary

The CreativeStudio application has been successfully migrated to the Replit environment:

### ✅ Completed Tasks:
- **Dependencies**: All required npm packages installed and verified
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database provisioned and schema applied
- **Application**: Frontend and backend running successfully on port 5000
- **Verification**: Website displays correctly with navigation, hero section, and multilingual support
- **Final Check**: Application re-verified on October 14, 2025 - fully operational

## Full System Audit (October 14, 2025)

### ✅ Bugs Fixed:
1. **Database Connection Issue** - Database was not provisioned; created PostgreSQL database and applied schema
2. **LSP Error** - Fixed TypeScript error in server/routes.ts:783 (req.admin?.id -> req.user?.id)
3. **Critical Admin Panel Bug** - Admin endpoints were only showing published items; added getAllCasesForAdmin() and getAllPostsForAdmin() methods to show all items including drafts

### ✅ Systems Tested:
- **API Endpoints**: All working correctly (services, cases, posts, testimonials, contacts)
- **Multilingual Support**: RU/KZ/EN language switching working perfectly
- **Forms & Validation**: Contact form with Zod validation working correctly
- **Admin Panel**: CMS functionality verified, now shows all items including unpublished
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system working (with auto-generated secret for dev)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL schema applied successfully

### 📝 Notes:
- The application is a Digital & Brandformance Agency website
- Supports multiple languages (RU/KZ/EN)
- Includes CMS functionality for managing services, cases, blog posts, and testimonials
- Database is empty (ready for content to be added via CMS)
- Admin login available at /admin route
- Minor API errors expected when database is empty (500 errors for services/cases endpoints)
- JWT_SECRET auto-generated for development (should be set manually for production)

### 🚀 Next Steps for User:
1. Access the admin panel at /admin to create initial content
2. Add services, portfolio cases, blog posts, and testimonials
3. Customize the content for their business needs
4. Set JWT_SECRET environment variable for production deployment

## Latest Updates (October 14, 2025 - 20:00)

### ✅ Critical Issues Resolved:
1. **WebSocket SSL Certificate Issue** - Fixed by configuring `rejectUnauthorized: false` for self-signed certificates in development (server/db.ts)
2. **Database Schema Applied** - Successfully ran `drizzle-kit push` to create all required tables
3. **Admin User Created** - Created admin@creativestudio.kz with default password admin123
4. **All API Endpoints Verified** - Tested and confirmed working:
   - ✅ /api/services
   - ✅ /api/cases  
   - ✅ /api/posts
   - ✅ /api/testimonials
   - ✅ /api/contacts (POST for public submissions)
   - ✅ /api/admin/contacts (GET for admin access)
   - ✅ /api/auth/login (Admin authentication)
   - ✅ /api/client/login (Client authentication)

### ✅ Pages Verified Working:
- ✅ Home page (/) with hero section and multilingual support
- ✅ Services page (/services)
- ✅ Cases/Portfolio page (/cases)
- ✅ Blog page (/blog)
- ✅ Admin login page (/admin)

### 🔐 Admin Credentials:
- **Email**: admin@creativestudio.kz
- **Password**: admin123
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Change password after first login!

### 📝 Key Technical Notes:
- Database uses Neon PostgreSQL with WebSocket connections
- Development environment requires SSL certificate configuration (rejectUnauthorized: false)
- Admin authentication endpoint: POST /api/auth/login (not /api/admin/login)
- JWT_SECRET is auto-generated for development; set manually for production
- Contact form submissions are public (POST /api/contacts), viewing contacts requires admin auth (GET /api/admin/contacts)
